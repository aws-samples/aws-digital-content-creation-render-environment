# AWS Digital Content Creation Render Environment (Linux Workstation)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aws-samples/aws-digital-content-creation-render-environment.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aws-samples/aws-digital-content-creation-render-environment)

This solution deploys an AWS Cloud environment that helps media and entertainment organizations with burst rendering workloads. This CloudFormation template will deploy and setup [AWS ThinkBox Deadline](https://www.awsthinkbox.com/deadline) Database and Repository, Workstation, License Server, and Render nodes.

The solution can deploy either Teradici PCoIP or NiceDCV Linux AMI workstation. Also there is an option to place workstation in a Private subnet and connect to it via AWS ClientVpn.

Furthermore, the solution comes with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) installation scripts, which is a popular open-source software for 3D modeling, animation, rendering and more...

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. To deploy the application you will require an AWS account. If you donâ€™t already have an AWS account, create one at <https://aws.amazon.com> by following the on-screen instructions. Your access to the AWS account must have IAM permissions to launch AWS CloudFormation templates that create IAM roles.
1. If deploying an [AWS Client VPN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-user/client-vpn-user-what-is.html) endpoint. You must generate a server/client certificate and upload those certificates to [AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html). Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/client-authentication.html#mutual) and follow the instructions in Mutual authentication to create  client and server certificates.
1. Configuration to AWS Client VPN is done via [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). You need to [install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and [configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) AWS CLI if you are planning to use Client VPN.

### Deployment

The environment is deployed as an [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) template.

> **Note**
You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this sample deployment. There is no additional cost for using this sample. For full details, see the pricing pages for each AWS service you will be using in this sample. Prices are subject to change.

1. Deploy the latest CloudFormation template by following the link below for your preferred AWS region:

   > It will take about 30 minutes for the deployment to finish.

#### Connect to Workstation deployed in Private Subnet
To connect to workstation in Private Subnet you will need to set up VPN client.

##### Step 1: Download the Client VPN Endpoint Configuration File
The configuration file includes the Client VPN endpoint and certificate information required to establish a VPN connection. You must provide this file to the clients who need to connect to the Client VPN endpoint to establish a VPN connection. The client uploads this file into their VPN client application.

**To download and prepare the Client VPN endpoint configuration file (AWS CLI)**

1. Note the **ClientVpnEndpointID** displayed in the **Outputs** tab of the **root** stack (it is the one without word **NESTED**).
1. Navigate to the folder with server and client certificates you have created as part of the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) in step 2.
   ```
   cd ~/custom_folder/
   ```
1. Download the Client VPN endpoint configuration file.
   ```
   AWS_REGION="the region you deployed CloudFromtaion stack into, e.g. us-east-1"
   ENDPOINT_ID="paste the id from step one"

   aws ec2 export-client-vpn-client-configuration --client-vpn-endpoint-id ${ENDPOINT_ID} --output text > client-config.ovpn --region ${AWS_REGION}
   ```
1. Append the client certificate and key to the Client VPN endpoint configuration file.
   ```bash
   cat >> client-config.ovpn
   cert ~/custom_folder/client1.domain.tld.crt
   key ~/custom_folder/client1.domain.tld.key

   CTRL+C
   ```
1. Verify that you have all the files in `~/custom_folder/` directory.
   ```
   ls -l

   ca.crt
   client-config.ovpn
   client1.domain.tld.crt
   client1.domain.tld.key
   server.crt
   server.key
   ```
##### Step 2: Configure OpenVPN Client
Now that we have VPN configuration file ready, the last step is to install VPN client on your machine. The following procedure shows how to establish a VPN connection using the `Tunnelblick` client application on a macOS computer.

```bash
brew search tunnelblick
brew cask install tunnelblick
```

Once the client is installed, please follow the
[AWS Connect to VPN documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-user/macos.html).

##### Step 3: Connect to Deadline workstation instance
Follow the same steps as in Connect to [Workstation deployed in Public Subnet](#connect-to-workstation-deployed-in-public-subnet)

## Render Something to Test the Setup

Now youâ€™ve got most of the pieces together, itâ€™s a good idea to test the setup to make sure you can submit a render from your workstation, have the Render Scheduler pick it up, and run the render on your Worker.

For this part, you will use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to render something.

Follow the instructions to:

* set up [Deadline Monitor](docs/deadline/workers-setup.md)
* set up [Blender and submit a job](docs/blender/blender.md)

## Local Development
See [Local Development](docs/develop/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) guide to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Running the tests

The solution has been tested using [taskcat](https://github.com/aws-quickstart/taskcat) the tool that tests AWS CloudFormation templates.

Install taskcat
```
pip install taskcat
```

> You need to package the templates to S3 before you can run the test below. See [Getting Started](#getting-started) instructions.

From within project root directory run:
```
taskat test run
```

You can modify the `taskcat` configuration file with your own tests here [.taskcat.yml](.taskcat.yml)

## Clean up

Follow these steps to clean up created resources:

1. In the **[CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation)**, select the the **root** stack you have created. For example `aws-digital-content-creation-render-environment `.
1. The **root** stack will handle the deletion of all the **children** stacks for you.
1. In the top right corner, click on **Delete**.
1. In the pop up window click on **Delete stack**.
1. You can click the **refresh** button a few times until you see in the status **DELETE_COMPLETE**.

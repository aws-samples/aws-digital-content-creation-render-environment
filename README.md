# AWS Digital Content Creation Render Environment

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aws-samples/aws-digital-content-creation-render-environment.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aws-samples/aws-digital-content-creation-render-environment)

This solution deploys an AWS Cloud environment that helps media and entertainment organizations with burst rendering workloads. This CloudFormation template will deploy and setup [AWS ThinkBox Deadline](https://www.awsthinkbox.com/deadline) Database and Repository, Workstation, License Server, and Render nodes.

Furthermore, the solution comes with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) installation scripts, which is a popular open-source software for 3D modeling, animation, rendering and more...

### Architecture

An overview of the architecture:

![architecture-png](./docs/aws-digital-content-creation-render-environment.png)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
# Create a S3 bucket
aws s3 mb s3://${BUCKET_NAME}

# Create an `.env` file and populate it with your own values
cp ./main/.env.example ./main/.env

# run the deployment script
./main/deploy.sh
```

### Prerequisites
To deploy the application you will require an AWS account. If you don’t already have an AWS account, create one at <https://aws.amazon.com> by following the on-screen instructions. Your access to the AWS account must have IAM permissions to launch AWS CloudFormation templates that create IAM roles.

### Deployment

The environment is deployed as an [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) template.

> **Note**
You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this sample deployment. There is no additional cost for using this sample. For full details, see the pricing pages for each AWS service you will be using in this sample. Prices are subject to change.

1. Deploy the latest CloudFormation template by following the link below for your preferred AWS region:

   > It will take about 13 minutes for the deployment to finish.

1. If prompted, login using your AWS account credentials.
1. You should see a screen titled **Create Stack** at the **Specify template** step. The fields specifying the CloudFormation template are pre-populated. Click the **Next** button at the bottom of the page.
1. On the **Specify stack details** screen you may customize the following parameters of the CloudFormation stack:

    |Parameter label|Default|Description|
    |---------------|-------|-----------|
    |Availability Zones | `Requires input` | The list of Availability Zones to use for the subnets in the VPC. Select **two** Availability Zones from your list. |

1. When completed, click **Next**.
1. [Configure stack options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html) if desired, then click **Next**.
1. On the **Review** screen, you must check the boxes for:
   * "*I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*"
   * "*I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names*"
   * "*I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might require the following capability: CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND*"

   These are required to allow CloudFormation to create a Role to allow access to resources needed by the stack and name the resources in a dynamic way.
1. Click **Create Change Set**.
1. On the **Change Set** screen, click **Execute** to launch your stack.
    > You may need to wait for the *Execution status* of the change set to become **AVAILABLE** before the **Execute** button becomes available.
1. Wait for the CloudFormation stack to launch. Completion is indicated when the **Stack status** is **CREATE_COMPLETE**.
    > You can monitor the stack creation progress in the "Events" tab.

### Login to Workstation and Start Deadline application

1. Note the **WorkstationPublicIP** displayed in the **Outputs** tab of the **root** stack (it is the one without word **NESTED**).
1. On the web browser or in the [NICE DCV Client](https://download.nice-dcv.com/), paste the **WorkstationPublicIP** and log in to the workstation with **ec2-user** credentials.

## Render Something to Test the Setup

Now you’ve got most of the pieces together, it’s a good idea to test the setup to make sure you can submit a render from your workstation, have the Render Scheduler pick it up, and run the render on your Worker.

For this part, you will use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to render something.

Follow the instructions to:

* set up [Worker Nodes](docs/workers-setup.md)
* set up [Blender and submit a job](docs/blender.md)

## Running the tests

The solution has been tested using [taskcat](https://github.com/aws-quickstart/taskcat) the tool that tests AWS CloudFormation templates.

Install taskcat
```
pip install taskcat
```

> You need to package the templates to S3 before you can run the test below. See [Getting Started](#getting-started) instructions.

From within project root directory run:
```
taskat test run
```

You can modify the taskcat configuration file with your own tests here [.taskcat.yml](.taskcat.yml)

## Clean up

Follow these steps to clean up created resources:

1. In the **[CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation)**, select the the **root** stack you have created. For example `aws-digital-content-creation-render-environment `.
1. The **root** stack will handle the deletion of all the **children** stacks for you.
1. In the top right corner, click on **Delete**.
1. In the pop up window click on **Delete stack**.
1. You can click the **refresh** button a few times until you see in the status **DELETE_COMPLETE**.
